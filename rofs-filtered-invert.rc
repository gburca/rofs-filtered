# vim: set filetype=conf :
#
# Configuration file for rofs-filtered (filtered ReadOnlyFileSystem)
#
# This is an example of how you need to configure things if you run
# rofs-filtered with the "invert" option enabled. In this mode, only
# files/directories that match the patterns here will be visible.
#
# Please read the instructions in rofs-filtered.rc first since they apply here
# as well.

# The next line denotes a special file type and the following line a RegEx.
|type:LNK
type:LNK

# It's not enough to specify a RegEx for a deep directory or file. The whole
# path down to that location must also be allowed or else we won't be able to
# navigate the file system.

# First we need to allow some basic filesystem functionality:
/$
/\.$
/\.\.$

# Allow access to the /subDir1 directory and everything that's under it
# (except for special files such as pipes and sockets):
subDir1

# Allow access only to .flac files in subDir2
subDir2$
subDir2/.+\.flac$
