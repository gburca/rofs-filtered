# vim: set filetype=conf :
#
# Configuration file for rofs-filtered (filtered ReadOnlyFileSystem)
#
# Comments must start with '#' in the first column.
# If the pattern is supposed to start with '#', use '\#' instead.
#
# This file is only read at start-up, so after modifying it, umount and
# re-mount the directory to make it take effect.

# Each line below should contain a RegEx (regular expression) pattern (no
# longer than 1023 characters) that matches the files to be filtered out (or
# hidden). The pattern is applied to the full path, starting at the mount
# point. See the regex(7) man page for the allowed syntax.
#
# For example, assume we have the following source directory structure mounted
# at /mnt/point :
#
# sourceDir/
# |-- block
# |-- character
# |-- file1.flac
# |-- file1.mp3
# |-- file2.mp3
# |-- file3.mp3 -> subDir1/file3.mp3
# |-- type:LNK
# |-- subDir1/
# |   |-- file3.flac
# |   |-- file3.mp3
# |   |-- fileA.mp3
# |   |-- pipe|
# |   |-- socket=
# |   `-- subSubDir1/
# `-- subDir2/
#     |-- fileA.mp3
#     |-- file4.flac
#     `-- file4.mp3
#
# The RegEx will be tested against:
# /
# /file1.flac
# /file1.mp3
# /file2.mp3
# /subDir1/
# /subDir1/file3.flac
# etc...
#
# Notice that it's not tested against the absolute location of the file (which
# would be /mnt/point/subDir1/file3.flac for example).

# Hide all *.flac files (all files or directories that end in ".flac"):
.*\.flac$

# Hide subDir2 (and all its contents), no matter where it appears in the tree:
/subDir2/$

# Hide the subDir2 but only if it occurs at the root of the tree:
^/subDir2/$

# Since a RegEx can not start with '|' (vertical bar), this symbol is used to
# escape out of RegEx mode and introduce special configuration flags.
#
# Special file types will be filtered out using these lines, see stat(2) for more details.
|type:CHR
|type:BLK
|type:LNK
|type:FIFO
|type:SOCK

# Note this is a RegEx filter, not a special file type filter.
type:LNK
